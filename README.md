# Lung Cancer Classification using CNNs

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project extracts features from histopathological images using pre-trained CNN models and trains an ensemble classifier for lung cancer classification.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `src/feature_extraction.py`: Loads images, extracts CNN features.
- `src/model_training.py`: Builds and trains the ensemble classifier.
- `data/`: Contains sample dataset files (not all included in the repository).
- `output/`: Stores extracted features and trained models.

## ðŸ›  Installation

## ðŸš€ Usage
Run the feature extraction script:
python src/feature_extraction.py

Train the model:
python src/model_training.py
